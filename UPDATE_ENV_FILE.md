# üîß URGENT: Update Your .env File

## Current Issue:
Your `.env` file has the wrong MongoDB connection string. It's currently set to:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gradeharvest
```

## ‚úÖ Solution:
You need to replace that line in your `.env` file with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### Step 1: Open your `.env` file
Open the `.env` file in your project root directory.

### Step 2: Find and replace the MONGODB_URI line
Replace this line:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gradeharvest
```

With your Atlas connection string (replace YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD):
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@gradeharvest.gvcnvhi.mongodb.net/gradeharvest?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=gradeharvest
```

### Step 3: Important Notes:
- Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD` with your actual MongoDB Atlas password
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- Make sure the line doesn't have any extra characters or line breaks
- The database name should be `/gradeharvest` (added after the cluster URL)

### Step 4: Save and restart
1. Save the `.env` file
2. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
3. Restart with `npm start`

## Example of correct format:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:MyPassword123@gradeharvest.gvcnvhi.mongodb.net/gradeharvest?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=gradeharvest
```

## After updating:
When you restart the server, you should see:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected Successfully!
üìç Host: gradeharvest-shard-00-02.gvcnvhi.mongodb.net
üóÑÔ∏è  Database: gradeharvest
```

Instead of the connection error.
